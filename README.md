# TEX-FZ-Anims

> [!Note]
> I am currently working on this and i will add a firmware mod for this so the animations change when it´s day or night

> [!Note]
> All of these animations have a already build folder with the .bm files instead of the .png files

> [!Note]
> If you want to change the text in the corner [Currently TEX-Flipper] just add a Bubble slot over it with you custom text

> [!Warning]
> Please give a credit if you modify these animations. If you don´t do that, my flipper, who got restartet so many times because of these animations, would be pretty sad :(

# Installation
- Option 1: For beginners: Drag and drop the folders from my github "bm Files" into your "dolphin" folder in "qflipper/SD Card". After that download the manifest.txt file from the dolphin folder and add the Animations from my manifest in there and upload it again to the dolphin folder. Restart your flipper and enjoy these beautiful animations

If you just want to have my animations without others, delete the dolphin folder and create a new empty one. After that just paste the files inside my github "bm Files" into the dolphin folder. Restart your flipper and enjoy these beautiful animations

- Option 2: Build yourself: I guess if you want to do this you know how to. (All files in pngs)
