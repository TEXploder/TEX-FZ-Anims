# TEX-FZ-Anims

>[!Note]
>I am currently working on this, and I will add a firmware mod for it so that the animations change based on whether it's day or night.

>[!Note]
>All of these animations already have a built folder with the .bm files instead of the .png files.

>[!Note]
>If you want to change the text in the corner [Currently TEX-Flipper], just add a Bubble slot over it with your custom text.

>[!Warning]
>Please give credit if you modify these animations. If you don't, my flipper, which has been restarted many times because of these animations, would be pretty sad :(

# Installation
- Option 1: For Beginners:
1. Drag and drop the folders from my GitHub "bm Files" into your "dolphin" folder located in "qflipper/SD Card".
2. Download the manifest.txt file from the dolphin folder.
3. Add the animations from my manifest into that file.
4. Upload the modified manifest.txt file back to the dolphin folder.
5. Restart your flipper and enjoy these beautiful animations.

- Option 2: If you only want my animations without any others:
1. Delete the existing dolphin folder.
2. Create a new empty dolphin folder.
3. Paste the files from my GitHub "bm Files" into the new dolphin folder.
4. Restart your flipper and enjoy these beautiful animations.

- Option 3: Build Yourself:
If you choose this option, I assume you know what you're doing. (All files are in PNG format).
